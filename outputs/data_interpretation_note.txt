DATA INTERPRETATION: Fan Vote Estimates in Rank Seasons
================================================================================

QUESTION: What do decimal values (e.g., 0.666) mean for Rank season estimates?

ANSWER: They represent NORMALIZED POPULARITY SCORES, not raw ranks.

EXPLANATION:

For PERCENT seasons (S3-S27):
- Values directly represent estimated fan vote share
- E.g., 0.35 means ~35% of total fan votes
- Sum across contestants in a week ≈ 1.0

For RANK seasons (S1-2, S28-34):
- Values represent a PROBABILITY/UTILITY transformation of rank
- We convert discrete ranks to continuous [0,1] scale for comparability
- Formula: score = (N - rank + 1) / N, where N = number of contestants
- E.g., with 4 contestants: 1st=1.0, 2nd=0.75, 3rd=0.5, 4th=0.25

WHY DECIMALS?
1. Allows direct comparison with percent-season estimates
2. Represents relative popularity (higher = more popular)
3. When multiple rank orderings are feasible, we report the centroid

INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
- 0.8+ : Very popular (top ranked)
- 0.5-0.8 : Moderately popular
- 0.2-0.5 : Less popular
- <0.2 : Low popularity (bottom ranked)

IMPORTANT: These are not probabilities that sum to 1!
They are relative popularity indices derived from rank constraints.
