# Visual Issues by Figure (Audit Before)

- Fig.1
  - Visual weight allocation: main flow and right-side "Special Rules" carry similar weight; primary path not dominant.
  - Reading path: main flow, branches, and outcomes compete; eye jumps between nodes instead of following a clear top-down route.
  - Information density (judge-unfriendly): small text and tight spacing create high cognitive load.

- Fig.2
  - Visual weight allocation: hatch textures and thick strokes dominate attention over the quantitative bars.
  - Reading path: legend-to-bar mapping requires extra decoding; color/texture dual encoding distracts.
  - Information density (judge-unfriendly): textures add noise and make numbers harder to scan quickly.

- Fig.3
  - Visual weight allocation: outer box, inner modules, arrows, and labels compete; core engine is not dominant.
  - Reading path: multiple arrows split attention and weaken the left-to-right flow.
  - Information density (judge-unfriendly): many modules with small text compress the hierarchy.

- Fig.4
  - Visual weight allocation: uniform color field lacks a focal contrast; key regions do not stand out.
  - Reading path: dense axes and colorbar pull attention away from the heatmap center.
  - Information density (judge-unfriendly): tight ticks and small labels overload the grid.

- Fig.5
  - Visual weight allocation: filled bands overpower the line trends.
  - Reading path: multiple line styles and legend proximity reduce immediate trend recognition.
  - Information density (judge-unfriendly): line/marker density is high relative to the small plot height.

- Fig.6
  - Visual weight allocation: colorbar competes with the matrix blocks.
  - Reading path: labels and blocks are mismatched in scale; scanning is interrupted.
  - Information density (judge-unfriendly): subtle block differences are hard to compare at a glance.

- Fig.7
  - Visual weight allocation: grid and line share similar weight; main curve not dominant.
  - Reading path: reference lines compete with the data line.
  - Information density (judge-unfriendly): frequent markers slow down reading.

- Fig.8
  - Visual weight allocation: vertical stems and dots have equal weight; trend is not dominant.
  - Reading path: scatter-like layout lacks a clear directional scan.
  - Information density (judge-unfriendly): point count is high with tight spacing.

- Fig.9
  - Visual weight allocation: two curves and baseline are similar in weight; key curve not prioritized.
  - Reading path: legend position interferes with end-of-series reading.
  - Information density (judge-unfriendly): dense markers and overlapping points reduce clarity near 1.0.

- Fig.10
  - Visual weight allocation: high-saturation points dominate; feature hierarchy is weak.
  - Reading path: symmetric point cloud + dense labels create visual blockage.
  - Information density (judge-unfriendly): too many features and small text increase reading load.

- Fig.11
  - Visual weight allocation: dense scatter and strong colorbar dominate; trend is hard to see.
  - Reading path: attention splits between scatter and colorbar without a clear focal guide.
  - Information density (judge-unfriendly): high point density with small labels is heavy to parse.

- Fig.12
  - Visual weight allocation: shaded band and line are similar weight; main curve not dominant.
  - Reading path: callouts and legend compete with the curve.
  - Information density (judge-unfriendly): annotations are clustered in a small area.

- Fig.13
  - Visual weight allocation: Pareto and ternary plots share equal weight; conclusion focus is diluted.
  - Reading path: side-by-side plots both demand attention; eye bounces between them.
  - Information density (judge-unfriendly): labels and points are dense with overlap risk.

- Fig.14
  - Visual weight allocation: many points/stems share equal weight; extremes are not emphasized.
  - Reading path: no dominant trajectory; scan is unfocused.
  - Information density (judge-unfriendly): numerous points with small variation reduce readability.

- Fig.15
  - Visual weight allocation: bar panel and line panel compete; emphasis is unclear.
  - Reading path: similar scale and layout on both panels weakens order of attention.
  - Information density (judge-unfriendly): bar density is high, trend reading is slow.
