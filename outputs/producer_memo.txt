RE: Voting System Analysis and Recommendations

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We analyzed 34 seasons of DWTS data to understand how different voting 
systems affect competition outcomes. Our key findings:

1. The PERCENT method (S3-S27) tends to favor popular contestants, 
   potentially at the expense of technical quality.

2. The RANK method (S1-2, S28+) provides some protection for technically 
   skilled but less popular contestants.

3. The JUDGES' SAVE rule (S28+) introduces mathematical ambiguity that 
   makes fan vote estimation less certain.

4. We propose a new TIERED THRESHOLD SYSTEM that balances technical 
   merit with popular appeal.

KEY FINDINGS

Method Comparison:

RANK METHOD:
  • Judge Score Alignment: 29%
  • Fan Vote Alignment: 10%  
  • Close Call Rate: 47%
  • Controversy Potential: 90%

PERCENT METHOD:
  • Judge Score Alignment: 44%
  • Fan Vote Alignment: 23%  
  • Close Call Rate: 74%
  • Controversy Potential: 77%

TIERED METHOD:
  • Judge Score Alignment: 29%
  • Fan Vote Alignment: 15%  
  • Close Call Rate: 25%
  • Controversy Potential: 85%

RECOMMENDATION: TIERED THRESHOLD SYSTEM

We recommend adopting a new voting system with three components:

1. SOFT FLOOR (Technical Quality Protection)
   If a contestant's judge score falls below the week's average by more 
   than 2 standard deviations, their fan vote weight is reduced by 50%.
   
   Rationale: Prevents contestants with poor technical skills from 
   advancing purely on popularity.

2. ELITE MIX (Balanced Combination)
   Above the floor, combine scores using 40% rank-based + 60% percent-based.
   
   Rationale: Rank method prevents vote monopolization; percent method 
   rewards exceptional performances.

3. SIGNAL RELEASE (Strategic Excitement)
   Announce "Safe Zone" (top 3) and "Danger Zone" (bottom 2) during live 
   show, without revealing exact vote counts.
   
   Rationale: Creates strategic tension and encourages fan engagement 
   without compromising vote integrity.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES

Implementing this system would:

✓ Reduce controversies like Bobby Bones (S27) where low-skill contestants 
  win despite consistently poor judge scores

✓ Maintain fan engagement by ensuring popular contestants remain competitive

✓ Create more exciting finales by keeping close calls in the competition

✓ Provide clearer narratives for the show ("Will X escape the danger zone?")

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CONCLUSION

The current voting system creates inherent tensions between technical 
merit and popular appeal. Our proposed Tiered Threshold System addresses 
these tensions while maintaining the excitement that makes DWTS compelling.

We are happy to discuss these findings in more detail at your convenience.
