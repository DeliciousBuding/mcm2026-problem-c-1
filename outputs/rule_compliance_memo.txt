RULE COMPLIANCE MEMO: Season 28+ Voting Method
================================================================================

QUESTION: Does our model correctly apply the voting rules for S28+?

ANSWER: YES ✓

PDF EVIDENCE (verbatim quotes):

1. "In the first two seasons of the U.S. show, the combination was based on 
   ranks."

2. "Season 2 concerns (due to celebrity contestant Jerry Rice who was a finalist 
   despite very low judge scores) led to a modification to use percentages 
   instead of ranks."

3. "Around this same season [S28], the producers also returned to using the 
   method of ranks to combine judges scores with fan votes as in seasons one 
   and two. The exact season this change occurred is not known, but it is 
   reasonable to assume it was season 28."

4. Footnote: "The year of the return to the rank based method is not known for 
   certain; season 28 is a reasonable assumption."

5. Appendix explicitly states:
   - "COMBINED BY RANK (used in seasons 1, 2, and 28a - 34)"
   - "COMBINED BY PERCENT (used for season 3 through 27a)"

DECISION RATIONALE:
- The PDF explicitly states S28-34 should use RANK method
- This is labeled as "a reasonable assumption" by problem authors
- Our implementation follows this guidance exactly

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Seasons 1-2: Rank method
- Seasons 3-27: Percent method  
- Seasons 28-34: Rank method + Judges' Save

ADDITIONAL JUDGES' SAVE RULE (S28+):
The PDF states: "The bottom two contestants were identified using the combined 
judge scores and fan votes, and then during the live show the judges voted to 
select which of these two to eliminate."

This creates ambiguity in our model because:
1. We don't know how judges voted between bottom two
2. Either bottom-two contestant could have been eliminated

Our approach: We model this as a "union of polytopes" - the eliminated contestant
must have been BOTH in the bottom two AND lost the judges' vote. This is handled
by our JudgesSaveHandler module.
