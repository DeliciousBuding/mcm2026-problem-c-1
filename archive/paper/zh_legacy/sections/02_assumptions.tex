\section{Assumptions}
\label{sec:assumptions}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{H\arabic*.}, leftmargin=2em, itemsep=0.3em]
    
    \item \textbf{Sincere Voting.} Viewers vote for favorites, not strategically.
    
    \item \textbf{Truthful Elimination.} Announced outcomes reflect stated rules; deviations are detectable model-data mismatches.
    
    \item \textbf{Vote Floor.} Each contestant receives minimum share $\epsilon > 0$ (default 1\%).
    
    \item \textbf{Rule Accuracy.} Documented production rules (immunity, double elimination, judge save) are correct.
    
    \item \textbf{Judge Independence.} Judges score before votes are tallied.
    
    \item \textbf{Temporal Independence.} Fans cannot condition on hidden vote shares from prior weeks.
    
    \item \textbf{Model-Data Mismatch Detection.} Unmodeled factors (e.g., judge save subjectivity, rule variations) manifest as constraint slack $S^* > 0$.

\end{enumerate}
