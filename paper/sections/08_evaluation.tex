\section{Model Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

We evaluate our framework via internal consistency checks, case studies, and computational efficiency.

\subsection{Internal Consistency}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.1em]
    \item \textbf{Posterior validity:} posterior means lie within LP/MILP feasibility bounds by construction.
    \item \textbf{Predictive validity:} PPC Top-3 coverage and Brier score (non-circular) are summarized in \figref{fig:ppc_metrics}.
    \item \textbf{Identification strength:} acceptance rate and gap probability indicate which weeks are weakly identified.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Posterior Predictive Checks}

\subsection{Computational Efficiency}
The end-to-end pipeline completes within a few minutes on a laptop for 3,000 MCMC samples per week. LP/MILP inversion remains sub-second per week, enabling pre-broadcast diagnostics.
