\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Background}

\textbf{Motivated by judge--fan disagreements}, we treat \emph{Dancing with the Stars} (DWTS) as an \textbf{audit problem}: can scoring rules explain eliminations \emph{without fan vote data}?

DWTS employs complex scoring mechanisms that have evolved significantly over 34 seasons (see \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:show_process}}). This evolution creates a unique \emph{inverse problem}: reconstructing latent fan votes from partial information.

\subsection{Problem Statement}

This paper addresses five interconnected audit questions:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., nosep, leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Fan Vote Inference (Tasks 1--2):} Reconstruct feasible fan support intervals from eliminations.
    \item \textbf{Rule Change Impact (Task 2):} How do immunity, double eliminations, and saves affect inference?
    \item \textbf{Success Factors (Task 3):} What predicts survival (profession, partner, fame)?
    \item \textbf{Mechanism Evaluation (Task 4):} Does the current system produce ``fair'' outcomes?
    \item \textbf{Mechanism Design (Task 5):} Can we improve fairness while maintaining engagement?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Contributions}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.1em]
    \item \textbf{Dual-Core Inversion + MaxEnt/Bayesian Reconstruction:} LP/MILP yields feasible intervals; Hit-and-Run + Gaussian random-walk prior produces posterior means and HDIs.
    \item \textbf{Assumption--Data Tension:} Slack and feasible-mass proxies diagnose weakly identified weeks without circular accuracy claims.
    \item \textbf{Counterfactual Evaluation:} Skill alignment, viewer agency, stability, and democratic deficit quantify rule impacts.
    \item \textbf{Feature Attribution:} Forward-chaining XGBoost + SHAP (with Cox cross-check) reveal dominant survival drivers.
    \item \textbf{DAWS Mechanism Design:} Uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting balances fairness and engagement, supported by a Pareto frontier and robustness tests.
\end{enumerate}
