\section{Sensitivity Analysis}
\label{sec:sensitivity}

We test robustness with respect to Bayesian smoothing, Judge Save behavior, and DAWS schedules.

\subsection{Bayesian Smoothing}
- Increasing samples tightens HDI widths but increases runtime linearly.  
- Smaller $\sigma$ (stronger random-walk prior) smooths trajectories but may understate abrupt changes; we report robustness to $\sigma$.

\subsection{DAWS Schedule}
- The $\alpha_t$ path respects the smoothness constraint $|\alpha_t-\alpha_{t-1}|\le \delta$ and remains stable under noise injection.

\subsection{Feature Attribution Stability}
Forward-chaining + $\sigma$ perturbation yields SHAP rank Spearman $\rho>0.9$, indicating stable attribution.
