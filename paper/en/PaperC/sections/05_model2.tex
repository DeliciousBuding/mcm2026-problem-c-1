\section{Model 2: Counterfactual Mechanism Evaluation}
\label{sec:model2}

\noindent\textbf{\textit{This section addresses Task 2:}} We keep inferred fan intent and judge scores fixed, then replay eliminations under alternative weighting rules to quantify fairness and stability.

\subsection{Metrics}
We evaluate each counterfactual rule using four complementary metrics:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.2em]
    \item \textbf{Skill Alignment:} Kendall's $\tau$ between mechanism score and judge percentages.
    \item \textbf{Viewer Agency:} frequency that the mechanism eliminates the same contestant as fan-minimum.
    \item \textbf{Stability:} entropy-based consistency of eliminations across posterior samples.
    \item \textbf{Democratic Deficit:} probability that rank-based rules overturn the percent-rule outcome.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\figref{fig:cf_matrix} summarizes the trade-offs across percent, rank, and rank+save systems. \figref{fig:save_sensitivity} shows robustness to alternative Judge Save behaviors, and \figref{fig:deficit} quantifies the information-theoretic democratic deficit of rank-only disclosure.
